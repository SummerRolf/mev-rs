# We patch `revm-primitives` so that all generated files go into the expected place ("OUT_DIR") which
# works well with rust `nix` builders and does not work well otherwise.
# TODO: It looks like later versions of this crate remove the problematic build script and so once `reth` updates
# (which indirectly uses this dependency) then we can drop this patch.
